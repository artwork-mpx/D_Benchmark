# A Benchmark Module for D

Andrei Alexandrescu proposed a std.benchmark module for inclusion in Phobos some three years ago. It hasn't
yet found it's way into Phobos for various reasons. The benchmark.d module in this repository is based on
the last version of Andrei's module from his fork of Phobos.  See the benchmark branch
https://github.com/andralex/phobos/tree/benchmark

https://github.com/andralex/phobos/blob/benchmark/std/benchmark.d was the start point for the module in this
repository.
